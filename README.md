# Universal Discord Hotkeys version 0.2 


### - What is this app?
UDH is a simple, lightweight script that allows the standard Discord navigation hotkeys to be accessible while tabbed out of Discord.



### - Why is this a thing?
Currently discord only allows for their application hotkeys to be used while tabbed into their app.
This means users who game on multiple monitors can't navigate Discord on another monitor while in game.



### - Does this cover all hotkeys?
No. Currently this program extends the channel and server navigation hotkeys only. This is to avoid some of the more common hotkeys Discord uses from impacting other apps.



### - What are the hotkeys? 

* Navigate Between Servers	Control + ALT + Arrow Key UP & Control + ALT + Arrow Key DOWN
* Navigate Between Channels	ALT + Arrow Key UP & ALT + Arrow Key DOWN

### - How do I make this app start on boot?

### - Does this program track what I do?
No. It is entirely local and has no connection to the internet




### - How was this made? 
This program was built using AutoHotKey. It was then compiled into a simple .exe using ahk2exe https://github.com/fincs/Ahk2Exe
